# SECURING-ROUTER-USING-MULTIPLE-ACCESS-CONTROL-TECHNIQES


ABSTRACT

A router is a device that forwards data packets along networks. A router is connected to at least two networks, commonly two LANs or WANs or a LAN and its ISP's network. Routers are located at gateways, the places where two or more networks connect.
In my project I will use window 2008 server as router to foreword data packet from one network to other. 
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a router protocol used to find the best path for packets as they pass through a set of connected networks.

In my project I will use OSPF protocol to foreword data packet from one network to others by using cisco router.
Access Control Lists (ACL) are very powerful security feature of Cisco IOS. 
By using Access Control Lists (ACL), we can deny unwanted access to the network while allowing internal users appropriate access to necessary services. Access Control Lists (ACL) are a set of commands, grouped together (by a number or name), that are used to filter traffic entering or leaving an interface. Access Control Lists (ACL)    commands define which traffic is permitted and which is denied.

In my project I am going to implement access (ACL) to filter the data that are coming in or going out of the network.  

I used packet tracer simulation program.
